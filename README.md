# cura-build

This repository contains build scripts used to build Cura and all dependencies from scratch.

## OS X

1. Install CMake (available via [homebrew](http://brew.sh/) or [cmake.org](http://www.cmake.org/))
2. Install latest version of Xcode.
3. On Mac OS X > 10.10, execute command: *brew link openssl --force*
4. Because Fortran is necessary: *brew install gcc*
5. Run these commands:
```shell
git clone git@github.com:Ultimaker/cura-build.git
cd cura-build
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

## Windows

On Windows, the following dependencies are needed for building:

* **git for windows** (https://git-for-windows.github.io/) The `git` command should be available on your `%PATH%`. Make sure that the `cmd` directory in the git for windows installation directory is on the `%PATH%` and *not* its `bin` directory, otherwise mingw32 will complain about `sh.exe` being on the path.
* **CMake** (http://www.cmake.org/) Once CMake is installed make sure it is available on your `%PATH%`. Check this by running `cmake --version` in the Windows console.
* **MinGW-W64** >= 5.3.0 (http://mingw-w64.org/doku.php) Once installed, its `bin` directory should be available on your `%PATH%`. Test this by running `mingw32-make --version` in the Windows console.
* **Python** 3.5 (http://python.org/, note that the version "3.5" is hardcoded across this project)
* **NumPy** (http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#numpy)
  You'll need to download a .whl from this site for Python 3.5 and install it via `pip install <your_whl_file>.whl`.
* **SciPy** (http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#scipy)
  You'll need to download a .whl from this site for Python 3.5 and install it via `pip install <your_whl_file>.whl`.
* **PySerial** from https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyserial/3.2.1
  It can be easily installed via `pip3 install pyserial`
* **PyQt5** from https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PyQt5/5.7
  It can be easily installed via `pip3 install PyQt5`
* **SIP** from https://pypi.python.org/pypi/SIP/4.18.1
  It can be easily installed via `pip3 install sip`
* **Zeroconf** from https://pypi.python.org/pypi/zeroconf/0.17.6
  It can be easily installed via `pip3 install zeroconf`
* **NumPy-STL** from https://pypi.python.org/pypi/numpy-stl/2.0.0
  It can be easily installed via `pip3 install numpy-stl`
* **LibArcus** from https://github.com/Ultimaker/libArcus
* **Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 (community edition)**: 
  Install Programming languages: Visual c++ (all), Python Tools for Visual Studio (Nov 2015)
  Windows & Web Development: Universal Windows App Development Tools (Tools 1.2 & windows 10 SDK-10/0/10586; Windows 10 SDK -10.0.10240)
* **cx_Freeze** (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/cx_Freeze)
  The easiest way to install this is to use a wheel (*.whl file) and install it via `pip install <your_whl_file>.whl`. You may have to add `<python dir>/Scripts` to you `%PATH%`. (Last tested version was: cx_Freeze-5.0-cp35-cp35m-win_amd64.whl)
* **NSIS 3** (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Main_Page) for creating the installer. Additional NSIS scripts are shipped with this project.

Make sure these dependencies are available from your path.

Additionally, for 32-bit builds:

* Perl (http://www.activestate.com/activeperl, Required to build Qt)
* Create in the user directory a file named pydistutils.cfg with the following contents:
```shell
[build]
compiler=mingw32
```

For 64-bit builds:

* PyQt 5.4 (https://riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/download5, Building PyQt currently fails using MinGW 64-bit)
* Install protobuf.wheel found in cura-build-binaries (TODO: create cura-build-binaries repo)
* Create empty ```__init__.py``` in c:\Python34\Lib\site-packages\google (TODO: make it part of the proto.wheel installation)

```shell
REM 32-bit
git clone git@github.com:Ultimaker/cura-build.git
cd cura-build
mkdir build
cd build
..\env_win32.bat
cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles" ..
mingw32-make
mingw32-make package
```

```shell
REM 64-bit
git clone git@github.com:Ultimaker/cura-build.git
cd cura-build
mkdir build
cd build
..\env_win64.bat
cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles" ..
mingw32-make
mingw32-make package
```

Before make package - copy arduino to cura-build/

## Ubuntu/Linux
